I wanted to explore the Monty Hall problem.
This program randomly puts a price behind one
of three doors, then randomly picks a door.
"Monty" opens a door that does not have a price,
and the player always switches its choice.
The process is run a million times, and
afterwards percentage of wins is printed.
It turns out to be ~66.6% wins as predicted
by the Monty Hall problem.
